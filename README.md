# OpenLayer 5 + React + Redux example

Basic example for using [OpenLayers 5](http://openlayers.org/) with [React](http://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

This demo uses node.js and parcel, so you need to install those first. Once you have node,
````bash
 npm install -g parcel
````
then you can run the demo with
````bash
 npm start
````
That should open the demo in a browser window; if it does open try hitting http://localhost:1234/

## Presentation

Slides from the presentation at FOSS4G 2015 in Seoul are available [here](http://blog.sourcepole.ch/assets/2015/foss4g2015_ol3_react.pdf).

The server supports hot reloading while keeping the application state.

## This version

I forked the version by @PirminKalberer and updated it.
This version is based on OpenLayers 5.
I tried to simplify the React code too, hope I succeeded.
I've also switched it to use the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) bundler.
